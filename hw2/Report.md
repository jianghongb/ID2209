The second assignment focuses on adding a second skill to an Agent, called FIPA for agent-based communication protocol to participate in auctions.

In short, add an Auctioneer (new Agent) that tries to sell a product at the festival using the FIPA communication skills. The Guests should communicate back using FIPA. The interaction should be based on the Dutch auction (can be found in slides) where the Auctioneer starts at a high price and reduces it in every round if no one is willing to buy it. If the price reaches a bare minimum price, the auction is terminated.

## Species
### New species Auctioneers
- Dutch auctions on merch
- Communicating through FIPA protocol 

## Implementation



## Results


## Challenge 1

Multiple auctions in the festival 
- Allow multiple auctions at the same time 
- Agents will only join the auction if they are interrested in the genere(Cloths, CD's etc...)



## Discussion / Conclusion
- More experience with Agents in GAMA
- Introduction to message passing and FIPA protocol in agents
- Experience working with Agent negotiation 
- Simulating and participating in an auction
