In this assignment, we were tasked with creating **a Basic Festival with Stores** in GAMA, and implement Task2 when Event1 happened.
## Species
### Agent A
### Agent B

## Implementation

<Explain a little bit how you went on with your assignment>
We started developing AgentA and made his simple behaviour work. When we had created AgentB,
the next logical step was to make Task1 achievable by implementing X using method Y...

## Results
<If there is anything interesting that you want to demonstrate, to proof that you have completed the
assignment, do that here>
As you can see in the following log, AgentB successfully completes Task2
AgentA: I‘m doing this
AgentB: Ok I‘m doing that
....
AgentB: Task2 completed at time xx.yy.zzzz
This can also be demonstrated from this fancy screenshot right here.
Figure 1: A screenshot of the final solution.


## Challenge 1
> Memory of Agents - Small Brain

To complete the first challenge, we added a variable "brain" which is List of Store to FestivalGuest, when useBrain is true, we will add the target store to the  "brain"  when the list length less than 2 and will get the target store from the  "brain"


## Challenge 2
> Removing Bad Behaviour Agents



## Creative implementation 

created that could broadcast messages to
all other agents. We used the Bully Algorithm to select and maintain a leader in our system, making it
fault tolerant.

Discussion / Conclusion
<Discuss what went well and what went bad in the assignment, what you thought of it and what you
learned>
Creating AgentA was no problem, but AgentB did not behave as we wanted to. The assignment was
really nice and thaught us how to X and Y, but Z was not so interesting and could be skipped or
improved. Overall a good assignment, can‘t wait to create a new version when I get back home to show
my friends and family!

## Discussion / Conclusion
- Introduction to the Gama platform
- Working with agents
- Learning the GAMA syntax
- Creating different types of agents
- Starting basic simulations
- Little bit of movement and behaviour
