## Species
### Agent A
### Agent B

## Implementation

<Explain a little bit how you went on with your assignment>
We started developing AgentA and made his simple behaviour work. When we had created AgentB,
the next logical step was to make Task1 achievable by implementing X using method Y...

## Results
<If there is anything interesting that you want to demonstrate, to proof that you have completed the
assignment, do that here>
As you can see in the following log, AgentB successfully completes Task2
AgentA: I‘m doing this
AgentB: Ok I‘m doing that
....
AgentB: Task2 completed at time xx.yy.zzzz
This can also be demonstrated from this fancy screenshot right here.
Figure 1: A screenshot of the final solution.


## Challenge 1
<Explain shortly how you went on by implementing the challenging features>
To complete the first challenge, we added a List variable to AgentA and an Array variable to AgentB.
The List held information and X and Y while the Array had information about Z...


## Challenge 2
<Same as the above, if there are two challenges or more>
Creative implementation
<You are free to express yourselves here. Keep it simple, but motivate why you should be awarded a
creative bonus point for your implementation>
For our creative solutions, we added a new agent, AgentÞ ( Þ is an Icelandic letter that sounds just like
the word the without the e. It‘s name is pronounced thodn) that took care of managing voting of agents
in the system to optimize Task2. Three of such agents were created that could broadcast messages to
all other agents. We used the Bully Algorithm to select and maintain a leader in our system, making it
fault tolerant.

## Creative implementation 

created that could broadcast messages to

fault tolerant.

Discussion / Conclusion
<Discuss what went well and what went bad in the assignment, what you thought of it and what you
learned>
Creating AgentA was no problem, but AgentB did not behave as we wanted to. The assignment was
really nice and thaught us how to X and Y, but Z was not so interesting and could be skipped or
improved. Overall a good assignment, can‘t wait to create a new version when I get back home to show
my friends and family!

## Discussion / Conclusion
- Introduction to the Gama platform
- Working with agents
- Learning the GAMA syntax
- Creating different types of agents
- Starting basic simulations
- Little bit of movement and behaviour
